# loss_aversion_disappear_and_reverse

This is raw data and code for Walasek and Stewart(2015).

Note: In the paper we describe the values in Experiment 2 as drawn from \$6-\$20 in \$2 increments and \$18-\$60 in \$6 increments. Actually Experiment 2 had distributions \$0-\$19 and \$0-\$59 in \$1 increments. We thank Quentin André and Bart de Langhe for spotting this.
